# HackAdemy
This project aims at setting a `kind of database` dealing with common `web appplication weaknesses and vulnerabilities`.

## Organization
In fact, there is a directory dedicated to each vulnerability. Within this, relevant and consistent information are fed. This information is supposed to be both `theorical and technical`; but mostly technical.
Therefore, we are trying, as much as possible, to start from scratch for the best understanding of the readers.

Here is the general structure of each case:
* Lexic
* Overview 
   * Acronyms - Definition
   * Exploitability
   * Impact
   * Components (server, client, etc)
   * Types 
* Vulnerability exploitation samples
* Presence detection
* Countermeasures guidelines
   * Server side
   * Client side
   * Possible policy(ies)
* Countermeasures implementation
* Common exploitation tools
