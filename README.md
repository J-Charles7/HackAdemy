# HackAdemy
This project aims at setting a `kind of database` dealing with common `web appplication weaknesses and vulnerabilities`.

## Organization
In fact, there is a directory dedicated to each vulnerability. Within this, relevant and consistent information are fed. This information is supposed to be both `theorical and technical`; but mostly technical.
Therefore, we are trying, as much as possible, to start from scratch for the best understanding of the readers.
