This project aims at setting a `base of information` dealing with common `web appplication weaknesses and vulnerabilities`.

## Organization
In fact, there is a directory dedicated to each vulnerability. Within this, relevant and consistent information are fed. This information is supposed to be both `theorical and technical`; but mostly technical.
Therefore, we are trying, as much as possible, to start from scratch for the best understanding of the readers.

Here is the general structure of each case:
* **Lexic**
* **Overview** 
   * **Acronyms - Definition**
   * **Exploitability**
   * **Impact**
   * **Components (server, client, etc)**
   * **Types**
* **How to test/check for**
   * **Whitebox**
   * **Graybox**
   * **Blackbox**
* **Vulnerability exploitation samples**
* **Presence detection**
* **Countermeasures guidelines**
   * **Server side**
   * **Client side**
   * **Possible policy(ies)**
* **Countermeasures implementation**
* **Common exploitation tools**
