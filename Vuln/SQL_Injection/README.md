# Overview
## Acronyms - Definition
SQL injection stangs for Structured Query Laguage injection. It is usually abbreviated as **SQLi**.
It is an attack that consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.
A successful SQL injection exploit can:
* read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), 
* execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS),
* recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.
