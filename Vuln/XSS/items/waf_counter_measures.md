# WAF XSS Counter Measures Implementation 

## OWASP CRS - Core Rule Set

The **OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)** is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, **including the OWASP Top Ten**, with a minimum of false alerts. The CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including:
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
* Local File Inclusion (LFI)
* Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
* Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* PHP Code Injection
* HTTPoxy
* Shellshock
* Session Fixation
* Scanner Detection
* Metadata/Error Leakages
* GeoIP Country Blocking
