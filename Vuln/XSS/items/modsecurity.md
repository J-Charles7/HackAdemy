# WAF ModSecurity 
**ModSecurity** is an open source, cross-platform **web application firewall (WAF) module**. Known as the "Swiss Army Knife" of WAFs, it 
enables web application defenders to gain visibility into HTTP(S) traffic and provides a power rules language and API to implement 
advanced protections.
ModSecurity is a toolkit for real-time web application **monitoring, logging, and access control**. I like to think about it as an 
enabler: there are no hard rules telling you what to do; instead, it is up to you to choose your own path through the available 
features. That's why the title of this section asks what ModSecurity can do, not what it does.

The freedom to choose what to do is an essential part of ModSecurity's identity and goes very well with its open source nature. 
With full access to the source code, your freedom to choose extends to the ability to customize and extend the tool itself to make 
it fit your needs. It's not a matter of ideology, but of practicality. I simply don't want my tools to restrict what I can do.
