# DOM - Document Object Model
## Description
The `Document Object Model` (DOM) is a `cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface` that 
treats an `HTML, XHTML, or XML document` as a `tree structure` wherein each node is an object representing a part of 
the document. The objects can be manipulated programmatically and any visible changes occurring as a result may 
then be reflected in the display of the document.
The principal standardization of DOM was handled by the `World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)`.
Beginning with the publication of DOM Level 4 in 2015, the `W3C` creates new recommendations based on snapshots of the WHATWG standard.
* DOM Level 1 provided a complete model for an entire HTML or XML document, including the means to change any portion of the document.
* DOM Level 2 was published in late 2000. It introduced the **getElementById** function as well as an event model and support for XML namespaces and CSS.
* DOM Level 3, published in April 2004, added support for XPath and keyboard event handling, as well as an interface for serializing documents as XML.
* DOM Level 4 was published in 2015. It is a snapshot of the WHATWG living standard.
