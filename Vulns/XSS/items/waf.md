# WAF - Web Application Firewall
## Description
A web application firewall (or WAF) `filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic` **to and from a web application**. 
A WAF is differentiated from a regular firewall in that a WAF is able to filter the content of specific web 
applications while regular firewalls serve as a safety gate between servers. 
All commercial WAF offerings `cover OWASP's ten flaws at a minimum`.
